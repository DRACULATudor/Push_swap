Push_swap is a project that teaches you about sorting algorithms and how to optimize them. The project involves sorting a stack of integers using a limited set of operations (push, swap and rotate) and minimizing the number of moves. 
At the beginning, you must have one stack, called stack a with all your numbers placed next to each other. With the help of the operations below, at the very end, all the numbers in your stack a will have to be sorted.
